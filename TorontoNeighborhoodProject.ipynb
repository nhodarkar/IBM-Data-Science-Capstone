The other 3 clusters are single neighborhoods, with cluster 2 being associated with parks, cluster 3 associated with home and garden, and cluster 4 having no clear association.  I would say that in this instance, cluster analysis probably did best at identifying park clusters.  Cluster 1 seems overly broad, while clusters 3 and 4 don't have a very clear identity."
